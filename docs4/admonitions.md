# Nested Admonitions

Use nested admonitions to ensure indentation and styling survive the import process.

!!! note "Outer note"
    This note wraps another admonition to mimic complex authoring patterns.

    !!! warning "Inner warning"
        Escalate when a shipment fails quality checks twice in a row.

        - Capture the batch ID for the incident log.
        - Notify the vendor contact immediately.

    The outer note continues after the inner block to confirm nesting is preserved.

!!! tip "Follow-up"
    Keep nested admonitions brief; combine them with *inline emphasis* for clarity.
