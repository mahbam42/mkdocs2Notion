# Images With Titles

The examples below pull from `docs/images/` to validate image handling with titles.

![Inventory diagram showing item flow](../docs/images/diagram.png "Warehouse Flow Diagram")

![Shelving photo used in the prototype](../docs/images/5866.jpg "Sample Inventory Photo")

Use these alongside *inline emphasis* in captions or surrounding text to ensure both render together.
